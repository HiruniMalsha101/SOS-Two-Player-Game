# SOS-Two-Player-Game
### General Info:
  - Plays a game of SOS
+ - Adjustable grid size
  - Only player vs player version completed ( player vs computer is still being developed)
  
  ### Complete Rules:
  * A grid of any size is drawn (usually > 5*5)
  * Two players take turns adding either an "S" or an "O" to an empty square in the grid 
  * They do not have to use the same letter each turn
  * If the player creates at least one SOS (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), they take another turn, and continue to do so until they can no longer create any
  * Once the board is full, the player with the most SOSs is the winner
  * [see more] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOS_(game))
  
  ### TLDR Rules:
  - A more complex ( and fun!) version of tic-tac-toe
